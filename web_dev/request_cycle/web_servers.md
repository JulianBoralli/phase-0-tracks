#What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux inherits its philosophy from Unix, where the key principle revolves around the idea that the user knows what he or she is doing.

Here is quote from a person named Doug Gwy, which also applies to Linux:

"Unix was not designed to stop its users from doing stupid things, as that would also stop them from doing clever things"


#In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

Its a space in memory, usually in the cloud and sold as a service. This space in memory can hold and run an operating system, which can be used as a server for client/server type applications.

#Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Because your system wouldn't be isolated if something bad happens, either by your own means, or by security loopholes in your system.
